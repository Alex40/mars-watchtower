Hey guys! We're going to be tackling the Wish You Were Here challenge collaboratively as a team, the goal of which is to develop a compelling representation of weather on Mars. (http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/wish-you-were-here/)

Here's our project page for now, more to come later: http://spaceappschallenge.org/project/mars-watchtower/

Officially Join the Team:
If you're interested in officially joining the team, first register at: http://spaceappschallenge.org/

To add you to the team, we need your email address that you registered with. Reply with your email below (or message me privately if you're uncomfortable with sharing it online).

How to Collaborate:
We are using cloud9 IDE to work together because it takes the hassle out of requiring everyone to set up their environment to run our code locally. Think of it as Google Docs for code. You can browse our code at https://c9.io/heyitsolivia/mars-watchtower

Initially you will only have read permissions. Request write permissions by clicking "chat" with project owner, at the top of the page. (You can register quickly by connecting your Github account.)
